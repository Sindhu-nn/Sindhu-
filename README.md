Objective :

To make a chatbot of 'guess the number' python base game that could exhilarate the people very much and especially the children more excite to play games.The intension of designing the guess the number python base game is to fall in interest with coding base games rather than mental stress games like pubg,temple run etc.....Now a days kids are often showing more interest towards useless games and mental stress games,those games are showing effect on their livestyles.So we've come with python base game "Guess The Numbers".

Task of the bot :

This chatbot project is an exciting fun game for playing python base game for children or anyother. The program generates a random number from 1 to 10, or 1 to 100 any range that is specified and the user must guess the number after a hint from the computer. Every time a userâ€™s guess is wrong they are prompted with more hints to make it easier for the user to guess the number but at the cost of reducing the score.The program also requires functions to check if an actual number is entered by the user or not, to compare the input number with the actual number, to find the difference between the two numbers.
